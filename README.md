# How to Install PeerGuardian 2 on Windows 7 64-bit with DSEO
  
PeerGuardian 2 is a privacy-oriented firewall application that blocks connections to and from hosts specified in huge blocklists (thousands or millions of IP ranges). It is mainly used to protect your privacy on peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, such as BitTorrent, by blocking the IP addresses of malicious or unwanted parties, such as anti-P2P organizations, spyware, adware, hackers, etc. PeerGuardian 2 is an open source project that was developed by Phoenix Labs, but it is no longer maintained or updated. However, you can still download and use it on Windows 7 64-bit with some modifications and a tool called Driver Signature Enforcement Overrider (DSEO).

## Step 1: Download PeerGuardian 2 and DSEO
  
You can download PeerGuardian 2 from [SourceForge]. The latest version is pg2-rc1-test2.exe, which was released in 2009. You can also download DSEO from [NGOHQ]. The latest version is dseo12.exe, which was released in 2010. Save both files to a convenient location on your computer.
  
## Step 2: Install PeerGuardian 2
  
Run pg2-rc1-test2.exe as an administrator and follow the installation wizard. Do not launch PeerGuardian 2 after the installation is complete.
  
## Step 3: Run DSEO
  
Run dseo12.exe as an administrator and click Next. You will see a warning message about the risks of using unsigned drivers. Click Yes to continue. On the next screen, select "Enable Test Mode" and click Next. This will allow you to install and run unsigned drivers on Windows 7 64-bit. You will need to restart your computer for the changes to take effect.
  
## Step 4: Sign the PeerGuardian Driver
  
After restarting your computer, run dseo12.exe again as an administrator and click Next. On the next screen, select "Sign a System File" and click Next. You will be asked to enter the path of the file you want to sign. Enter C:\Windows\System32\drivers\pgfilter.sys and click OK. This is the driver file for PeerGuardian 2 that needs to be signed in order to work on Windows 7 64-bit. You will see a confirmation message that the file has been successfully signed. Click OK and then Exit.
  
## Step 5: Launch PeerGuardian 2
  
You can now launch PeerGuardian 2 from the Start menu or the desktop shortcut. You will see a notification that PeerGuardian is running in test mode. This is normal and expected. You can ignore it or disable it from the settings menu. You can also update your blocklists from the list manager or download new ones from [iblocklist.com]. You can customize your settings and preferences from the options menu.
  
## Conclusion
  
You have successfully installed PeerGuardian 2 on Windows 7 64-bit with DSEO. You can now enjoy the benefits of blocking unwanted connections and protecting your privacy on P2P networks. However, you should be aware that PeerGuardian 2 is not a foolproof solution and it may not block all malicious or unwanted IP addresses. You should also use other security measures, such as antivirus software, firewall, VPN, etc., to enhance your online safety.

## Troubleshooting
  
If you encounter any problems or errors while installing or running PeerGuardian 2 on Windows 7 64-bit with DSEO, you can try the following solutions:
  
- If you get a message that says "PeerGuardian is unable to load the packet filtering driver. This could happen if PeerGuardian crashed and didn't have a chance to unload the driver, or if the file pgfilter.sys can't be found", you can try to manually start the driver by opening a command prompt as an administrator and typing `net start pgfilter`. If that doesn't work, you can try to reinstall PeerGuardian 2 and sign the driver again with DSEO.
- If you get a message that says "PeerGuardian can't load any blocklists. Please make sure you have at least one list in your settings", you can try to update your blocklists from the list manager or download new ones from [iblocklist.com]. You can also check your settings and make sure that the path of your blocklists is correct and that they are not corrupted or empty.
- If you get a message that says "PeerGuardian has detected an IP address attempting to connect to your computer. This could be a false positive, or it could be someone trying to monitor your activity", you can check the details of the IP address by clicking on it in the history tab. You can see the country, organization, and description of the IP address, as well as the protocol, port, and direction of the connection. You can also search for more information about the IP address on [Whois] or [IP Lookup]. You can decide whether to allow or deny the connection, or add it to your allow or block list.
- If you have any other issues or questions, you can visit the [PeerGuardian Forums] or the [DSEO Forums] for more help and support from other users and developers.
